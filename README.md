# Introduction

Welcome to the Campus Rover Lab Notebook, a living resource for and by the students of COSI 119a at Brandeis University. We've been building this document over the last 5 or so years of this course. It has grown tremendously with a variety of kinds of information.

From time to time we try prune and reorganize it to make it easier to navigate. But it will continue to be a hetergenous collection of content. Invatiably some of it will become obsolete or dated as software and hardware continues to evolve.
