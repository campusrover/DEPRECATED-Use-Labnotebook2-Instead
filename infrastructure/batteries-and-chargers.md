# Batteries and Chargers

## Danger

LiPo batteries are dangerous. When mistreated they can cause a major fire. This is a serious concern and we ask you to be careful and take this seriously.

## Fire Extinguisher

There is a fire extinguisher in the lab. It is near the main door, on the left as you enter the lab.

## Danger signs

* When charging, LiPo batteries will become warm. As long as you can put your palm on it and keep it there for 10 seconds you are more or less ok.
* If a LiPo battery becomes hot to the touch, immediately unplug it and put it into one of the safety bags.
* If a LiPo battery starts emitting smoke or sparks, this is a fire emergency. Luckily we've not experienced this ever.
* If a LiPo battery deforms in any way, that is bulges out on one of the sides, that battery is defective and should not be used any more.

## Chargers

We have many different types of chargers.
